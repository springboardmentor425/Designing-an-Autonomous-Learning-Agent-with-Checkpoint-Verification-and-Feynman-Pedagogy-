# Introduction to Deep Learning
Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that involves the use of artificial neural networks to analyze and interpret data. This concept has gained significant attention in recent years due to its ability to learn and improve on its own by adjusting the weights and biases of the neural network. The key attributes of deep learning include its ability to learn from large amounts of data, its capacity to handle complex and high-dimensional data, and its ability to improve the accuracy of predictions and decisions.

## Definition and Dimensions of Deep Learning
Deep learning is defined as a type of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers to learn and represent complex patterns in data. The dimensions of deep learning include the type of data used, the architecture of the neural network, and the algorithms used to train the network. According to [Deep Learning](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/) by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville, deep learning involves the use of neural networks with multiple layers to learn and represent complex patterns in data. The book provides a comprehensive overview of the concepts and techniques used in deep learning, including the types of neural networks, the algorithms used to train them, and the applications of deep learning.
